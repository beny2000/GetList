        </p>

        <h3>Backend Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            The app's backend is powered by Python, FastAPI, and Docker. These technologies work together seamlessly
            to provide a robust and scalable foundation for the app's functionalities.
        </p>

        <h3>Frontend Technologies</h3>

        </p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Magic</h3>
        <p>
            The app employs BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a cutting-edge machine learning model
            from Huggingface, to intelligently classify items by store types and suggest relevant nearby stores.

            MongoDB, equipped with geospatial search functionality, handles the storage and retrieval of geolocation data for stores and items.
